help.metric.description     = The metrics calculated by static code analysis are different. Following are definitions of "non trivial" metrics:<br/><br/><div class="separateurParagraphe"></div><p class="titreParagraphe ">Cyclomatic complexity v(G)</p>Cyclomatic complexity measures the complexity of decisions in a module's structure. It is the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code. Thus it is also the number of paths that will need to be tested. <br>Using a control graph with e segment(s) and n nodes, its cyclomatic complexity is:<br/><br/><code>v(G) = e \u2013 n + 2</code><br/><br/><div class="separateurParagraphe"></div><p class="titreParagraphe ">Essential cyclomatic complexity ev(G)</p>Essential cyclomatic complexity quantifies to what extent a module includes unstructured code. For example: jump out of a loop, jump into a loop, jump out of or into an if structure. <br/>Ev(G) is calculated by deleting all structured constructs of the module's control graph. The cyclomatic complexity is then calculated from the reduced graph obtained. The graph clearly shows the unstructured parts of code. By accepting unstructured code in a program section, unstructured code is automatically generated in at least one other program section.<br/><div class="separateurParagraphe"></div><p class="titreParagraphe ">Integration cyclomatic complexity iv(G)</p>Integration cyclomatic complexity iv(G) is the module's complexity reduced to its integration graph. This reflects the complexity with which the module calls directly subordinate modules. <br/><br/>In the control graph, all decisions and loops without calls are deleted. Iv(G) is equal to the cyclomatic complexity of the reduced graph.<br/><br/><div class="separateurParagraphe"></div><p class="titreParagraphe ">Coupling Between Object Classes (CBO)</p>This is the number of classes on which a given class depends on outside inheritance. <br/>In the case of a class dependent on classes outside its hierarchy being added to a library, all other classes on which it depends must also be added. This may be acceptable if all the classes in question are part of the same library.<br/><br/><div class="separateurParagraphe"></div><p class="titreParagraphe ">Lack Of Cohesion of Methods (LOCM)</p>For each data element in the class, the percentage of methods by which it is used is calculated. The average of these percentages is calculated and reduced by 100%. <br/>If the percentage is low, cohesion is good. If the percentage is high, this indicates that the class could be divided into several classes, each with improved cohesion.<br/>
